# SlimUIExtensions

You are free to use this however you like, this was roughly written so I don't guarantee it to work for your project, there might be bugs (more than likely will) however, I don't have the time to fully flesh this out.

I'm just leaving this open for any other person who uses SlimUI https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/cursor-controller-pro-161628 and need it to be expanded such that you can interact with sliders and scrollbars in Unity while using the old Unity Input System.
